# zoning-lookup
A table to make it easy for databases to interact with zoning code

## Chicago
The Chicago table is adapted and expanded from the [Second City Zoning](https://secondcityzoning.org/zones/) table (to which I've also contributed to, but it's mainly the work of Juan-Pablo Velez and Derek Eder.

## Evanston 
I'm going to try and learn the Evanston zoning code and make the Chicago and Evanston ones "fit" each other.
